What is the algorithm to find the majority in a sequence of elements (IE the item that appears the most)?	Boyer-Moore Majority algorithm
What is the algorithm to find a number in a SORTED sequence that performs in O(log n) time?	Binary Search
Why is "left + (right - left) / 2" better than (right - left) / 2?	Because by subtracting left from right we assure that we won't overflow an integer (if the input can be too high).
