What are the primitive data types that Java has?	byte, short, int, long, decimal, double, char and boolean.
What are the referece data types that Java has?	Strings, arrays and all other data structures like Dictionaries, queues, etc.
What is the difference between reference and primitive data types?	Primitive data types are stored in the main memory and the bit values are saved directly into variables. Reference types on the other hand, store a pointer in the variable that points to the location in the heap which is managed by the JVM.
How do you build a Java program? With no frameworks!	You first create your class or classes with the .java extension. You then compile the files, starting with the one that has the main method using javac nameOfClass.java and then you run it with the command java nameOfFile with no extensions.
What should be public in a Java class?	The methods, getters and setters that the user needs to use the class.
What should be private in a Java class?	The variables/properties to avoid .dot notation access.
What is the difference of using the "==" operator in a primitive data type versus a reference data type?	The "==" operator checks if the value stored in the variable is equals. It will check if primitive data types are equal or not becauase their value is directly stored in the variable. Rerefence types are not directly stored in the variable so this will check if their pointer is the same or if they are pointing to the same thing.
What are the default values of instance variables?	For numerical values and char is 0, for booleans is false and for reference types is null.
What are the default values of local variables?	They do not have a default value, the compiler will not compile the code because they need to be initialized.
What is a wrapper class and how can it be used?	A wrapper class is any of the data type classes such as Character, Boolean, Integer etc. They are used to get certain information about that data type like the min and max values. It's a way to use primitive data types as objects.
How do you explicitly cast in Java? IE double to integer?	You put the data type you want to convert into in parenthesis before the expression or data type that you want to convert. For example (int) doubleValue;.
What is the default data type for whole numbers?	Integer.
What is the default data type for decimal numbers and why?	Double. Because it's more precise.
How do you overload a method?   By writing another method with the exact same name and access modifiers but different parameters.
What is a statement in programming? It's a line or multiple lines of code that may or may not include any expressions. A statement gives the computer instructions on what to do.
What is an expression in programming?   It's code that has to resolve to a literal value.
What is a parameter?    The definition of the input the method requires to work.
What is an argument?    The input the programmer passes to the method when they call it.
What are the access modifiers in Java?  Public, Private, Protected, and Default.
